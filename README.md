# Community Survey: Update on OVRLand Names

Dear Over the Reality Community,

As you are aware, our project has divided the world into 300 square metre hexagons called OVRLand, each identified by a unique name generated by an algorithm. We have recently identified that some of these names include terms that may infringe on copyrights or could be considered offensive to some individuals.

## Purpose of the Survey:

We are seeking community feedback on the proposed update to the names of certain OVRLand. This update aims to ensure compliance with copyright laws and to maintain a respectful and inclusive environment.

### Attached to this survey, you will find:

- A list of problematic terms currently in use.
- Proposed replacement terms.
- The list of OVRLand affected by these changes.

***Example:***

- Current Name: kazaa.nice.retardation
- Proposed Name: kazaa.nice.lumen

### Survey Question:

**Do you agree with the proposed changes to the names of the OVRLand as outlined above?**

- Yes, I agree with the name changes.
- No, I do not agree with the name changes.

Your feedback is crucial in ensuring that our project respects both legal rights and the values of our community. Thank you for your participation and continued support.

**Additional Information:**
